# Features

## Radius pickup
While holding the configured hotkey (default Left Shift or Left Bumper on controller) and using the pickup action the player will automatically harvest all pickupable items of the same type in a configurable radius around the target. This is mainly intended for assisting with farming, but also works on world spawn pickups like rocks/sticks/berries and beehives.

## Grid planting
Additionally, when planting crops, if the hotkey is held will plant in a grid around the original target within the crosshair (5x5 default grid size).

Options to disable stamina cost and cultivator's durability when planting.
