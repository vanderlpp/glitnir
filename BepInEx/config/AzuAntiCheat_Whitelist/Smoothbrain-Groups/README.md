# Groups

Adds basic group features to the game. Has an API to allow mod authors to integrate group features into their mods. For more information on how to use the API, please check out [the GitHub page](https://github.com/blaxxun-boop/Groups).

Use the following chat commands to manage your groups:

/invite [name] - sends a group invitation to the specified player

/leave - leaves your current group

/remove [name] - removes the specified player from your group

/promote [name] - promotes the specified player to group leader

The commands requiring a name support autocompletion. Just press TAB.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.

### Included features

***Group chat***

You can use /p [text] to write messages that only your group can read. Or you can use /p without any text to toggle the group chat mode. All your messages will then be send to your group, until the group chat mode is toggled off using /p again.

***Health display***

You can see your group members and their current health on the left side of the screen. You can drag and drop this interface to a different place. To free your mouse, just hit ESC.

You can also customize this interface quite a bit in your personal configuration.

***Colored names***

People in your group have their name colored differently, when you meet them in the world. You can change this color in your personal configuration.

***Map location***

You can see your group members on the map at all times, even if they do not share their location publicly. They also have their map icon colored in the group color.

***Friendly fire***

Friendly fire can be disabled for group members. So, even if you have PvP enabled, you cannot hit each other, while you are in the same group.

***Group ping***

You can hold a modifier key (default: Left ALT) pressed, while you are pinging the map, to make the map ping visible to group members only.
