Huge thanks to zarboz, GraveBear, and plumga for helping me get going, setting me up, and encouraging me the whole way! This mod wouldn't exist without them.
Also a big thanks to my "players" on my server (my husband and our good friend) Itsmesds, and JaxomFaux who've helped with ideas and balance from the start. (Bone Appetit's name came from us haning out when itmesds said how about "bone appetit" and it stuck)
