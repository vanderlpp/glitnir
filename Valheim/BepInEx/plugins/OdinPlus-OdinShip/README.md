# Thanks

My sincere thanks to the entire OdinPlus team -  <i>@Azummat - @Blaxxun's</i> and @Lunchbox for the 3D models and for appreciating my work.

A special thanks to my Professor <i>@GraveBear</i>, without his teachings and his encouragement I would never have gotten it.

I want to thank Archaeologist and 3D artist Alberto Foglia who donated one of his most beautiful models (Viking Longship - Skuldelev 2) to be used in our mod and further enrich our Viking world.Few people in the world have such a kind heart. Follow his wonderful work at the link below.
