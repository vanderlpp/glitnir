**Produced by: Raelaziel#0954**

## IMPORTANT INFO!
**Fundamental and game-braking changes! I am changing chests and storages sizes which will be smaller, just to get rid of "Equipment Glitch" which is critical from very long time. Before updating for 1.2.6 and newer make sure you back-up your world and temporary move all your items from Bronze Storages, Iron Storages, Crates and Barrels. Thanks to that you will avoid item loss!**

### Dependencies

This mod isn't standalone, to make it work properly you will need some other mods called dependencies so make sure that everything is installed as it should. To make it work properly you need 2 hard depencencies and the list is below.

* BepInEx Valheim
* Jotunn the Valheim Lib (not JotunnLib) called JVL

## Distribution

I don't mind much what you will do with this mod. You can redistribute it, you can edit it, you can place it in your modpacks without asking me. 
I am doing it in free time, for free using free software and legal copy of the game which i am not owner so atleast the last sentence should explain much why this should be shared and continued if someone is interested.

However, just don't recompile this mod and call it Yours. 
Also i didn't uploaded any mod source because it's mess for this moment and i think it will be shame to give it to anyone, so more informations about it soonTM but if someone is impatient just use some nice software to reproduce it.
